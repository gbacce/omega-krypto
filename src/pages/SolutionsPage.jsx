            <p>Format Preserving Encryption (“FPE”) preserves the unconditional security and the advantage that the encryption process timing can be accurately estimated based on the size of the information to be encrypted or decrypted independently of its content.  Due to their intrinsic simplicity, all these substitutions are very fast.  An algorithm using them and complying with IMMUNE’s seven-step process can easily be implemented within existing systems without the need of massive investments in computational power or data structures’ modification.</p>
            <p>FPE is also a method that respects both the length of what you want to encrypt and its
type of data:</p>
